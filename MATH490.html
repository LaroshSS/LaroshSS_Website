                    <li> Met with Dr. McGuirk, talked more about finalizing talks. </li>

                        <li> Looking into conferences and symposiums </li>

                            </ul>
                        <li> Honestly after looking through this stuff, I looked through NYU, Columbia, and just locally, theres not many to go to in a 3 month span. All of them require a good bit of money. </li>
                        <li> I think I will set up an event at the school, and invite faculty and students to come purely for lecturing practice. I will flesh out this talk as I go, but I'm leaning towards talking about a PCA analysis, and using League gameplay data to do it.  Depending on how far along in my Neural Network progress I get, maybe a brief prototype</li>

                            <li> Working on a proof of concept having a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. </li>
                            <li> Also working on writing up Paolo Gasti's machine learning algorithm linked below. </li>

                            <li> Make powerpoints for a talk, and flesh out my progress in short talks to give Dr. Katsnelson and Dr. Roy </li>
